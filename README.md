Allows you to create and manage sets of plugins within WordPress.

## Description

This plugin allows you to create sets of profiles within WordPress so you can test the performance of your website and how it is affected by the different plugins.
This comes in handy in some cases, e.g.:
- when optimizing a website and you are not sure which plugin causes your website to be slow
- if you are looking for alternatives and you want to compare the performance

and probably more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. How can I reset the plugin set I used to have before installing this plugin?

After you install the plugin a default profile is created from the set of activated and deactivated plugins. It is not yet possible to recover the default profile, but rather use it as overview. However it can be overwritten by any profile you create by clicking on "Make default profile".
